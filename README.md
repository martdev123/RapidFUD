# RapidFUD
*NEW METHOD*

* Just rewritten in python, this should resolve problem compatibility between x86 and x64 linux distros #powerofpython
just open terminal and run python FUD.py



*A simple runner to generate a spoofed cert for msfvenom payload to bypass all AV's signature*


#OLD METHOD
1 Extract archive
2 open terminal and type chmod 777 FUD64.elf


3 then type in terminal sudo su
then ./FUD64.elf

4 Fud crypter needs like 5 minutes to stay idle in order to download dependancies (leave open in terminal for a while)

While tool is running generate a msfvenom payload in the same folder where crypter is located

Supported just by Kali Linux AMD64

Sometimes main files are missing becouse it's still working in progress

---> ZIP Archive password: msfconsole <---

After generating the spoofed-cert version of new-fresh generated payload make it harder to be scouted by using x86/shikata_ga_nai and aes256 encryption
