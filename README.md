# RapidFUD
A simple runner to generate a spoofed cert for msfvenom payload to bypass all AV's signature

Usage

open terminal
sudo git clone https://github.com/martdev123/RapidFUD

1) Extract the correct version of the signer by checking your Kali Linux distros (x64, x86)
2) chmod 777 FUD64.elf
3) Open terminal as ROOT;
4)  Type ./FUD64.elf (depending on your type of distro)
5)  Runner will download dependancies automatically and this will take approximatively 10 minutes, keep it open on terminal;
6)  Keep it running while generating a msfvenom payload and drop it in the same folder of where the runner is located
